# 1's Complement Subtraction using Parallel Adders – CircuitVerse

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **binary subtraction using 1's complement** technique with the help of **parallel adders** in [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org). The design illustrates how subtraction can be achieved by inverting the bits of the subtrahend and adding it to the minuend using a ripple-carry structure, followed by end-around carry handling.

## ✅ Key Features
- **Functionality**: Performs binary subtraction A - B using the 1's complement method
- **Inputs**:
  - `A[3:0]` – 4-bit Minuend
  - `B[3:0]` – 4-bit Subtrahend
- **Outputs**:
  - `Diff[3:0]` – 4-bit binary difference
  - `Carry` – End-around carry flag (if used)
- **Controlled using**: Parallel full adders, NOT gates for 1’s complement, and logic for carry adjustment

## ⚙️ How 1's Complement Subtraction Works

To compute A - B using 1’s complement:
1. Take 1’s complement of `B` (invert each bit).
2. Add it to `A` using a 4-bit ripple-carry adder.
3. If there is a carry-out, add `1` to the result (end-around carry).
4. If no carry, the result is in 1's complement form → take complement again for negative result.

## 📊 Example

| A (Minuend) | B (Subtrahend) | 1's Comp(B) | A + 1's Comp(B) | Final Result |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
|  1010 (10)   |  1001 (9)      |  0110     |     0111        | 0001 (1)      |

> Carry-out exists → add it back → final result is 2
