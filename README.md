# Combinational Circuits in CircuitVerse

This repository contains a curated collection of essential **combinational digital circuits** implemented using [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org). These designs are foundational for understanding data flow and control logic in digital systems and VLSI design. Each folder represents a well-documented circuit simulation, complete with schematics and optional video demonstrations.

### 🔹 3x8 Decoder
- **Function**: Decodes a 3-bit binary input into 8 distinct output lines.
- 📁 Folder: `3x8_decoder/`

### 🔹 4-Bit ALU
- **Function**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR on 4-bit inputs.
- 📁 Folder: `4bit_alu/`

### 🔹 4-Bit Full Adder
- **Function**: Adds two 4-bit binary numbers with carry propagation.
