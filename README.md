# 4-bit ALU – CircuitVerse

## 🔧 Project Description
A 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) designed in CircuitVerse. Performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR based on 3-bit opcode.

## ✅ Features
- 4-bit inputs A and B
- Supports operations: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR
- Controlled using opcode selector
- Built and simulated on CircuitVerse platform
